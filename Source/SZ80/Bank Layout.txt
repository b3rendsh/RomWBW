S100 Z80 CPU
============

S100 Z80 has only a small monitor ROM at the to of CPU address space
which is not utilized by RomWBW.  RomWBW treats the system as a
ROMless system.  RAM is provided by a separate board.  RomWBW assumes
the RAM board has >= 1024K which is the maximum RAM supported by the
Z80 CPU memory manager.

The ROMless startup mode treats the entire 1024KB as RAM.  128KB of RAM 
must be preloaded by the Monitor CF Loader.  There will be no ROM 
disk available under RomWBW.

The RomWBW 32K bank layout is as follows:

Bank		Contents	Description
--------	--------	-----------
0x0		BIOS		HBIOS Bank (operating)
0x1		IMG0		ROM Loader, Monitor, ROM OSes
0x2		IMG1		ROM Applications
0x3		IMG2		Reserved
0x4-0xF		RAMD		RAM Disk Banks
0x10-1B		APP		Application Banks
0x1C		BUF		OS Buffers (CP/M3)
0x1D		AUX		Aux Bank (CP/M 3, BPBIOS, etc.)
0x1E		USR		User Bank (CP/M TPA, etc.)
0x1F		COM		Common Bank, Upper 32KB

Memory Manager
--------------

The Z80 CPU implements a custom memory manager that allows mapping the 2
lowest 16K portions of CPU address space ($0000-$3FFFF, and $4000-$7FFF).
Each of these banks can be mapped to any physical 16K bank.
The physical 16K banks are 16K aligned.  The memory manager
can address a maximum of 1MB of physical memory.  Which is
64 x 16K banks (bank numbers $00-$3F)

The top 32K of CPU address space ($8000-$FFFF) is statically mapped
to physical banks $02 & $03.  RomWBW is designed to have the top
32K of CPU address space assigned to the last two banks of
RAM.  So the RomWBW memory manager for this board (MM_SZ80)
rotates the requested bank numbers by 4.  With wrapping, this
causes a RomWBW request for the top two banks to be mapped to
physical banks $02 & $03.

Z80 CPU Physical:  00 01 02 03 ... 38 39 3A 3B 3C 3D 3E 3F
RomWBW Logical:    04 05 06 07 ... 3C 3D 3E 3F 00 01 02 03

As a result, the Z80 CPU Monitor loads RomWBW starting at
physical bank 04.


S100 FPGA Z80 SBC
=================

FPGA Z80 has no real ROM.  It has a single onboard 512K RAM chip.

RomWBW assumes the use of the T35 FPGA with associated firmware.

The ROMless startup mode treats the entire 512KB as RAM.  384KB of RAM 
must be preloaded by the FPGA Monitor CF Loader.  There will be no ROM 
disk available under RomWBW.

The RomWBW 32K bank layout is as follows:

Bank		Contents	Description
--------	--------	-----------
0x0		BIOS		HBIOS Bank (operating)
0x1		IMG0		ROM Loader, Monitor, ROM OSes
0x2		IMG1		ROM Applications
0x3		IMG2		Reserved
0x4-0xB		RAMD		RAM Disk Banks
0xC		BUF		OS Buffers (CP/M3)
0xD		AUX		Aux Bank (CP/M 3, BPBIOS, etc.)
0xE		USR		User Bank (CP/M TPA, etc.)
0xF		COM		Common Bank, Upper 32KB

Memory Manager
--------------

The T35 FPGA Z80 implements the Zeta 2 (Z2) memory manager.
