===== HI-TECH Z80 CP/M C compiler V3.09-17 =====

The HI-TECH C Compiler is a set of software  which
translates  programs written in the C language to executable
machine code programs. Versions are available which  compile
programs  for  operation under the host operating system, or
which produce programs for  execution  in  embedded  systems
without an operating system.

This is the Jun 2, 2025 update 19 released by Tony Nicholson who currently
maintains HI-TECH C at https://github.com/agn453/HI-TECH-Z80-C.

The manual is available in the Doc/Language directory,

== Enhanced Version ==

User area 1 contains another complete copy of the HI-TECH C Compiler.
It is identical to the copy in user area 0 except for the following files
which were enhanced by Ladislau Szilagyi from his GitHub Repository at
https://github.com/Laci1953/HiTech-C-compiler-enhanced.  The files
take advantage of additional banked memory using the RomWBW HBIOS API.
As such, they require RomWBW to operate.  They should be compatible with
all CP/M and compatible operations systems provided in RomWBW.

The enhanced files are:

- CGEN.COM
- CPP.COM
- OPTIM.COM
- P1.COM
- ZAS.COM (replaced with Z80AS)
